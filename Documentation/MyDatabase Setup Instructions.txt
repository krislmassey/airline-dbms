MYDATABASE.PY SETUP

=====================================================
=====================================================




======
STEP 1:  CONNECT TO TARGET DATABASE SERVER
======

-	Make sure the local machine is connected and able to
	recieve information from the target device

-	To test this, ping the target device (in this case
	Muto (10.44.2.128)) and make sure there is no packet loss

======
STEP 2:  LOG IN TO phpMyAdmin
======

-	Make sure a database is already set up on the server you are connecting to

-	By using your favorite browser,log into phpMyAdmin @ server_IP/phpmyadmin/   
	(example: type in browser  10.44.2.128/phpmyadmin/)

-	Make sure you are able to log into the webpage with your
	username (example: root) and password credentials (example: alabio)

-	MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PERMISSION TO EDIT TABLES.
	This is very important. Most database functions will not work unless
	you are granted priviledges. The master-command to grant all privileges
	to a user is as follows.
	
	After selecting the SQL tab in phpMyAdmin, fill in the template below:
	
	<GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON databaseName.* TO 'username'@'machineIP'
	IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;>

	Note: databaseName, username, machineIP, and password represent the
	actual values of these data points that you will enter into the command

	Example:
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TestDB2.* TO 'root'@'172.22.114.186'
	IDENTIFIED BY 'alabio' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 

        Copy and paste this command into the box in the "SQL" tab.
	Then press <Go> button.  The command should execute and a green box
	should appear at the top with the command you entered.  This means it
	executed successfully. If instead a red box appears then there is
	either a problem with your SQL syntax or another issue.  
         
	

-	To verify that command has run successfully, go to the sidebar of database under the purple and orange "phpMyAdmin" logo.  Scroll down until you find the "mysql"
	link and click on it.  Another list of tables should drop down.  Scroll down these tables until you find one named 'user' and left click on it.
	On this table will be a list of all users, their hosts, passwords (encrypted), and the priviledges they have.  Check to make sure the username
	you entered is there.  Do not be overly concerned if not all of the privilege boxes say "Y".  If you ran the grant privileges command you should
	have the privileges for the database you specified.  However if you try to run MyDatabase and continually experience write errors, you can manually go in
	to this page, click the "Edit" link near the yellow pencil icon, and manually change all of your
	privileges to "Y".  If you are still having connection problems at this point, the error is probably springing from something else.  Another big potential
	problem you might be facing is the MySQL client interface you are using.  How to deal with this is explained in step 4.

======
STEP 3:  DOWNLOAD MYSQL INTERFACE FOR YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM (assuming you're using windows 7)
======

-	The primary dependency of MyDatabase.py is the MySQLdb module incorporated
	in it.  To use this the local machine must by equipped with the MySQL framework

-	For windows 7 machines, a download of MySQL can be found at the following link:
	http://www.codegood.com/archives/129

	Download the applicable version for your machine and install it.

-       Install the app by using defaults (just keep clicking "next") 

-	Make sure that MySQL is set up in the filepath of your machine.  At this point
	if your MyDatabase module has been showing up an import error for "import MySQLdb"
	that should go away now.  If not...  further troubleshooting required

======
STEP 4:  DOWNLOAD MYSQL CLIENT FOR YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM (assuming you're using windows 7)
======

-	If your machine doesn't already have the MySQL client installed go to
	dev.mysql.com/downloads

-	Click on the link titled "MySQL on Windows (Installer & Tools)"

-	Click on "MySQL Installer"

-	Scroll down the page and click on the blue "Download" button by the topmost title
	that should say something like "Windows (x86, 32-bit), MSI Installer	5.6.19	1.5M"

-	Run through the download procedures.  Make sure your computer has all of the required
	frameworks to proceed.  You will need the .Net framework as well as microsoft excel 2007

-	After the installer is successfully loaded make sure that its directory is in your computer's
	path.  To add it to the path go to:

	Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Advanced > Environmental Variables > Select "Path" under "System Variables" > Click "Edit"

	Once you are into the editor, append the filepath of your mysql client folder to the end

	The client folder should be named something like "C:\mysql-5.6.19-winx64\bin"

- 	After this is added go back to the MyDatabase.py document in your python editor of choice and
	make sure the import statement is not turning up an error.
