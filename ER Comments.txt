Kristen and Nathan,
You need to add a Leg Instance entity that holds 
data for a leg traveled on a specific date by a 
specific airplane (tail number).  This is different 
from the scheduled leg which specifies only the day 
of the week scheduled.

Your design will be improved by adding an airplane 
type entity which holds all data common to a type.  
I showed an example of this in class.

Best regards, Ed
